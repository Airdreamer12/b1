<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This is a Java application tool to design castle layouts for the game <a href="http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/">http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/</a>.<p/>
<p>Designs are saved as images for easy access, and barcoded to allow the image to be loaded. An alphanumeric version of the barcode can also be exported/imported.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type:disc">
<li>Buildings are placed quickly and efficiently by dragging the mouse.</li>
<li>Buildings can be removed in the same way with the right mouse button.</li>
<li>Designs are saved in a lossless png format.</li>
<li>The saved images can be reloaded back into the designer since each image has its information barcoded for forwards compatibility.</li>
<li>For when images cannot be used (such as the Stronghold Kingdoms ingame mail system), an alphanumeric version of the barcode may be accessed.</li>
</ol>
